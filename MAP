./data/index.csv: Some static data inserted as a sheet into the output spreadsheet
./directory.sh: Opens the BN-97-1 documentation
./to_csv.py: Generate a human-usable CSV file of a version of the survey
./extract_questions.py: Extract all data for each question across all survey versions. WIP.
./regenerate.py: Used to test map.yaml's correctness by generating questions from it
./regeneration_test.sh: Compares questions from map.yaml (via regenerate.py) and *__field_attributes.csv
./report.sh: Produces summary stats from the run log
./map.yaml: Describes the survey in a machine readable way that could be useful for this project e.g. relationships between versions of questions, branches. WIP.
./utils/utils.py: Just contains a single function relating to map.yaml processing. Probably should become map.py and pull in more of the yaml-processing functionality.
./utils/pdkit.py: Contains a single Pandas helper function, which I think checks to see if a value exists anywhere in a dataframe.
./utils/csv_combinator.py: Does complex Pandas things to generate a dataaframe of the count of every response to every question across all versions of the survey.
./utils/csv2xlsx.py: Converts input csv files into sheets in an Excel spreadsheet. Used to pull together to_csv.py output.
./utils/fnam_col.py: Converts between Excel-style column names and V-codes.
./Makefile: Rules to build all of this stuff.
./requirements.txt: Python dependencies.
./requirements_all.txt: Python dependencies, including some extras.

Glossary
========
I've got a bit of terminology, but may not be using it consistently.
version: A 'version' of the survey.
v-code: The code representing a particular question in a particular survey.
response: The response given in answer to a particular question.
r-code: The code representing the response given in answer to a particular question.
